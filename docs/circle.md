Circle
======

A circle is a simple closed shape. It is the set of all points in a
plane that are at a given distance from a given point, the centre;
equivalently it is the curve traced out by a point that moves in a plane
so that its distance from a given point is constant. The distance
between any of the points and the centre is called the radius. This
article is about circles in Euclidean geometry, and, in particular, the
Euclidean plane, except where otherwise noted.

Area of a circle
----------------

$$ A = \pi r^2 $$

-   $A$ = Area of circle

-   $r$ = radius of the circle
